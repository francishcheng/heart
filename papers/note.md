### abstract 
- Our understanding of coronary syndromes has evolved in the last two decades out of the **obstructive athero-sclerosis** of epicardial coronary arteries paradigm to include **anatomo-functional** abnormalities of coronary microcirculation. 
- (MCE) was a breakthrough in echocardiography several years ago that claimed the capability to detect myocardial perfusion abnormalities and quantify coronary blood flow.
- integration of quantitative MCE and fractional flow reserve improved the definition of ischemic burden(负担) and the relative contribution of collaterals in non-critical coronary stenosis.
- overall, MCE improved echocardiographic evaluations of ischemic heart disease in daily clinical practice, but the approval of regulatory authorities is lacking.
### intruduction
-  Clinical data in the last two decades challenged this paradigm and shifted the attention to the possible role of anatomical and functional abnormalities of the **coronary microcirculation** throughout the clinical spectrum of myocardial ischemia.
#### Functional assessments of coronary microvasculature have become the challenge
	- not possible to visualize microcirculation
	- but description of its function is avaliable, AKA evaluating coronary blood flow 

	##### several methods describing its function
	1. TIMI
	2. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiograpy 
	3. PSECT
	4. PET
	5. MCE, advantages: low-cost, bedside, but it is limited (MCE is still waiting)[./Myocardial contrast echocardiography perfusion imaging, still waiting after all these years.pdf]


### MCE protocols
#### ultrosound contrast agents
#### physical pronciples
#### imaging modalities
#### QUATIT
